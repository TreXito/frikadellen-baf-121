## ⚠️ Partial Implementation

### Bot Integration (Stubs)
- [ ] **Azalea Plugin System** - Requires Azalea 0.15 integration
- [ ] **Microsoft Auth** - Authentication flow needed
- [ ] **Hypixel Join** - Server connection logic
- [ ] **Window Click Packets** - Actual packet sending
- [ ] **Chat Sending** - Message transmission
- [ ] **Window Opening** - Detect window open events

**Status**: All logic is implemented as documented functions. Integration requires:
1. Implementing Azalea plugin traits
2. Hooking into packet handlers
3. Connecting event channels to bot events

**Documentation**: See `src/bot/README.md` for integration guide

## 🚫 Not Implemented (Optional Features)

These features exist in TypeScript but are not critical:

### Web GUI (0%)
- [ ] Web server for browser interface
- [ ] Real-time flip display
- [ ] Chat message relay
- [ ] Command execution via web

**Reason**: Console-only operation is sufficient. Web GUI can be added later.

### Advanced Features (0%)
